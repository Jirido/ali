# The alix function alix to read all the aliases in ~/bash_alix that is without the '' around the command strings.
# the real aliases is in ~/bash_aliases so when removing you have to remove the alias in them both. Alix could be rewritten to strip the '' from the aliases in ~/.bash_alaises so we could get rid of the file ~/.bash_alix all together. I'm just not cut out for it.
# Also it would then be easier to make an delete funktion. I know i'm bad. 
# I would also love a cind of search funktion to use when looking for the alias to delete. I would like a self updating list of matches from ~/bash_aliases. Like.. i write delali and then it asks me what alias i would like to delete and narow the list as i write. 
# It could match both the alias and the command string. That would be sweet. Also warn if i try to ad a alias already in the alias file.
